# RESEARCH

- Inspired by: jeli, blameless, incident.io, rootly --> https://rootly.io/api#/
- Simple static page hosted in Fly.io; able to add public visibility of autogenerated templates and supplement from actual marked
- Can manually add content in dynamic location in case of outage in other mechanisms
- Have an internal page only accessible to Twingate/Tailscale for co-ordination; hosted in Fly.io
- Internal will have more data; and can even mirror what is from consolidated chat + other marked data.  It clearly marks any active incidents and can look at previous ones
- Use 100ms toolkit for quick video/screen share + backup chat; in case of primary
- Have a Slackbot user listen in channel and it mirrors event into sqlite localstore blob
- Use Temporal to track the lifecycle of the incident and also post-incident follow ups + tracking of success
- Use Temporal to get signal from identified PIC for common keywords like: root cause, resolved, next update (reminder)
- Use Temporal to track pre-mortems or avoided issues as well for learning of other members; searchable and becoming Runbooks reference.  Part of Incident Library Learning + Training; has 100ms recordings ...
- Use Temporal to track PIC overall incident commander + team/service owner affected
- Use Temporal to manage the lifecycle of incident assets like 100ms channel + Slack channel
- Use Temporal to mark flow that is Training / Test; and to convert existing
- Bridge via SCIM v2 to underlying universal identity graph - go-lmk
